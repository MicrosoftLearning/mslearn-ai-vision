# Develop a vision-enabled chat app

In this exercise, you use the *Phi-4-multimodal-instruct* generative AI model to generate responses to prompts that include images. You'll develop an app that provides AI assistance with fresh produce in a grocery store by using Azure AI Foundry and the Azure AI Model Inference service.

This exercise takes approximately **30** minutes.

## Create an Azure AI Foundry project

Let's start by creating an Azure AI Foundry project.

1. In a web browser, open the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com) at `https://ai.azure.com` and sign in using your Azure credentials. Close any tips or quick start panes that are opened the first time you sign in, and if necessary use the **Azure AI Foundry** logo at the top left to navigate to the home page, which looks similar to the following image:

    ![Screenshot of Azure AI Foundry portal.](../media/ai-foundry-home.png)

2. In the home page, select **+ Create project**.
3. In the **Create a project** wizard, enter a valid name for your project and if an existing hub is suggested, choose the option to create a new one. Then review the Azure resources that will be automatically created to support your hub and project.
4. Select **Customize** and specify the following settings for your hub:
    - **Hub name**: *A valid name for your hub*
    - **Subscription**: *Your Azure subscription*
    - **Resource group**: *Create or select a resource group*
    - **Location**: Select any of the following regions\*:
        - East US
        - East US 2
        - North Central US
        - South Central US
        - Sweden Central
        - West US
        - West US 3
    - **Connect Azure AI Services or Azure OpenAI**: *Create a new AI Services resource*
    - **Connect Azure AI Search**: Skip connecting

    > \* At the time of writing, the Microsoft *Phi-4-multimodal-instruct* model we're going to use in this exercise is available in these regions. You can check the latest regional availability for specific models in the [Azure AI Foundry documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/deploy-models-serverless-availability#region-availability). In the event of a regional quota limit being reached later in the exercise, there's a possibility you may need to create another resource in a different region.

5. Select **Next** and review your configuration. Then select **Create** and wait for the process to complete.
6. When your project is created, close any tips that are displayed and review the project page in Azure AI Foundry portal, which should look similar to the following image:

    ![Screenshot of a Azure AI project details in Azure AI Foundry portal.](../media/ai-foundry-project.png)

## Deploy a multimodal model

Now you're ready to deploy a multimodal model that can support image-based input. There are several models you could choose from, including the OpenAI *gpt-4o* model. In this exercise, we'll use a *Phi-4-multimodal-instruct* model that support prompts that include images.

1. In the toolbar at the top right of your Azure AI Foundry project page, use the **Preview features** (**&#9215;**) icon to ensure that the **Deploy models to Azure AI model inference service** feature is enabled. This feature ensures your model deployment is available to the Azure AI Inference service, which you'll use in your application code.
2. In the pane on the left for your project, in the **My assets** section, select the **Models + endpoints** page.
3. In the **Models + endpoints** page, in the **Model deployments** tab, in the **+ Deploy model** menu, select **Deploy base model**.
4. Search for the **Phi-4-multimodal-instruct** model in the list, and then select and confirm it.
5. Agree to the license agreement if prompted, and then deploy the model with the following settings by selecting **Customize** in the deployment details:
    - **Deployment name**: *A valid name for your model deployment*
    - **Deployment type**: Global Standard
    - **Deployment details**: *Use the default settings*
6. Wait for the deployment provisioning state to be **Completed**.

## Test the model in the playground

Now that you have a multimodal model deployment, you can test it with an image-based prompt in the chat playground.

1. In the navigation pane on the left, select the **Playgrounds** page and open the **Chat** playground.
1. 1. In a new browser tab, download [mango.jpeg](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-vision/raw/refs/heads/main/Labfiles/08-gen-ai-vision/mango.jpeg) from `https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-vision/raw/refs/heads/main/Labfiles/08-gen-ai-vision/mango.jpeg` and save it to a folder on your local file system.
1. On the chat playground page, in the **Setup** pane, ensure that your **Phi-4-multimodal-instruct** model model deployment is selected.
1. In the main chat session panel, under the chat input box, use the attach button (**&#128206;**) to upload the *mango.jpeg* image file, and then add the text `What desserts could I make with this fruit?` and submit the prompt.

    ![Screenshot of the chat playground with an image-basd prompt.](../media/chat-playground-image.png)

1. Review the response, which should hopefully provide relevant guidance for desserts you can make using a mango.

## Create a client application

Now that you've deployed the model, you can use the deployment in a client application.

> **Tip**: You can choose to develop your solution using Python or Microsoft C# *(coming soon)*. Follow the instructions in the appropriate section for your chosen language.

### Prepare the application configuration

1. In the Azure AI Foundry portal, view the **Overview** page for your project.
2. In the **Project details** area, note the **Project connection string**. You'll use this connection string to connect to your project in a client application.
3. Open a new browser tab (keeping the Azure AI Foundry portal open in the existing tab). Then in the new tab, browse to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) at `https://portal.azure.com`; signing in with your Azure credentials if prompted.

    Close any welcome notifications to see the Azure portal home page.

1. Use the **[\>_]** button to the right of the search bar at the top of the page to create a new Cloud Shell in the Azure portal, selecting a ***PowerShell*** environment with no storage in your subscription.

    The cloud shell provides a command-line interface in a pane at the bottom of the Azure portal. You can resize or maximize this pane to make it easier to work in.

    > **Note**: If you have previously created a cloud shell that uses a *Bash* environment, switch it to ***PowerShell***.

5. In the cloud shell toolbar, in the **Settings** menu, select **Go to Classic version** (this is required to use the code editor).

    **<font color="red">Ensure you've switched to the classic version of the cloud shell before continuing.</font>**

1. In the cloud shell pane, enter the following commands to clone the GitHub repo containing the code files for this exercise (type the command, or copy it to the clipboard and then right-click in the command line and paste as plain text):


    ```
    rm -r mslearn-ai-vision -f
    git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-vision
    ```

    > **Tip**: As you paste commands into the cloudshell, the ouput may take up a large amount of the screen buffer. You can clear the screen by entering the `cls` command to make it easier to focus on each task.

7. After the repo has been cloned, navigate to the folder containing the application code files:  

    **Python**

    ```
   cd mslearn-ai-vision/Labfiles/08-gen-ai-vision/python
    ```

    **C#**

    ```
   cd mslearn-ai-vision/Labfiles/08-gen-ai-vision/c-sharp
    ```

8. In the cloud shell command line pane, enter the following command to install the libraries you'll use:

    **Python**

    ```
   python -m venv labenv
   ./labenv/bin/Activate.ps1
   pip install python-dotenv azure-identity azure-ai-projects azure-ai-inference
    ```

    **C#**

    ```
   dotnet add package Azure.Identity
   dotnet add package Azure.AI.Inference --version 1.0.0-beta.3
   dotnet add package Azure.AI.Projects --version 1.0.0-beta.3
    ```

9. Enter the following command to edit the configuration file that has been provided:

    **Python**

    ```
   code .env
    ```

    **C#**

    ```
   code appsettings.json
    ```

    The file is opened in a code editor.

10. In the code file, replace the **your_project_connection_string** placeholder with the connection string for your project (copied from the project **Overview** page in the Azure AI Foundry portal), and the **your_model_deployment** placeholder with the name you assigned to your Phi-4-multimodal-instruct model deployment.
11. After you've replaced the placeholders, in the code editor, use the **CTRL+S** command or **Right-click > Save** to save your changes and then use the **CTRL+Q** command or **Right-click > Quit** to close the code editor while keeping the cloud shell command line open.

### Write code to connect to your project and get a chat client for your model

> **Tip**: As you add code, be sure to maintain the correct indentation.

1. Enter the following command to edit the code file that has been provided:

    **Python**

    ```
   code chat-app.py
    ```

    **C#**

    ```
   code Program.cs
    ```

2. In the code file, note the existing statements that have been added at the top of the file to import the necessary SDK namespaces. Then, Find the comment **Add references**, add the following code to reference the namespaces in the libraries you installed previously:

    **Python**

    ```python
   # Add references
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
   from azure.ai.inference.models import (
        SystemMessage,
        UserMessage,
        TextContentItem,
        ImageContentItem,
        ImageUrl,
   )
    ```

    **C#**

    ```csharp
   // Add references
   using Azure.Identity;
   using Azure.AI.Projects;
   using Azure.AI.Inference;
    ```

3. In the **main** function, under the comment **Get configuration settings**, note that the code loads the project connection string and model deployment name values you defined in the configuration file.
4. Find the comment **Initialize the project client**, add the following code to connect to your Azure AI Foundry project using the Azure credentials you are currently signed in with:

    **Python**

    ```python
   # Initialize the project client
   project_client = AIProjectClient.from_connection_string(
        conn_str=project_connection,
        credential=DefaultAzureCredential())
    ```

    **C#**

    ```csharp
   // Initialize the project client
   var projectClient = new AIProjectClient(project_connection,
                        new DefaultAzureCredential());
    ```

5. Find the comment **Get a chat client**, add the following code to create a client object for chatting with your model:

    **Python**

    ```python
   # Get a chat client
   chat_client = project_client.inference.get_chat_completions_client(model=model_deployment)
    ```

    **C#**

    ```csharp
   // Get a chat client
   ChatCompletionsClient chat = projectClient.GetChatCompletionsClient();
    ```

### Write code to submit a URL-based image prompt

1. Note that the code includes a loop to allow a user to input a prompt until they enter "quit". Then in the loop section, find the comment **Get a response to image input**, add the following code to submit a prompt that includes the following image:

    ![A photo of a mango.](../media/orange.jpeg)

    **Python**

    ```python
   # Get a response to image input
   image_url = "https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-vision/raw/refs/heads/main/Labfiles/08-gen-ai-vision/orange.jpeg"
   image_format = "jpeg"
   request = Request(image_url, headers={"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0"})
   image_data = base64.b64encode(urlopen(request).read()).decode("utf-8")
   data_url = f"data:image/{image_format};base64,{image_data}"

   response = chat_client.complete(
        messages=[
            SystemMessage(system_message),
            UserMessage(content=[
                TextContentItem(text=prompt),
                ImageContentItem(image_url=ImageUrl(url=data_url))
            ]),
        ]
   )
   print(response.choices[0].message.content)
    ```

    **C#**

    ```csharp
   // Get a response to image input
   string imageUrl = "https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-vision/raw/refs/heads/main/Labfiles/08-gen-ai-vision/orange.jpeg";
   ChatCompletionsOptions requestOptions = new ChatCompletionsOptions()
   {
        Messages = {
           new ChatRequestSystemMessage(system_message),
           new ChatRequestUserMessage([
                new ChatMessageTextContentItem(prompt),
                new ChatMessageImageContentItem(new Uri(imageUrl))
            ]),
        },
        Model = model_deployment
   };
   var response = chat.Complete(requestOptions);
   Console.WriteLine(response.Value.Content);
    ```

2. Use the **CTRL+S** command to save your changes to the code file - don't close it yet though.

3. In the cloud shell command line pane beneath the code editor, enter the following command to run the app:

    **Python**

    ```
   python chat-app.py
    ```

    **C#**

    ```
   dotnet run
    ```

4. When prompted, enter the following prompt:

    ```
   Suggest some recipes that include this fruit
    ```

5. Review the response. Then enter `quit` to exit the program.

### Modify the code to upload a local image file

1. In the code editor for your app code, in the loop section, find the code you added previously under the comment **Get a response to image input**. Then modify the code as follows, to upload this local image file:

    ![A photo of a dragon fruit.](../media/mystery-fruit.jpeg)

    **Python**

    ```python
   # Get a response to image input
   script_dir = Path(__file__).parent  # Get the directory of the script
   image_path = script_dir / 'mystery-fruit.jpeg'
   mime_type = "image/jpeg"

    # Read and encode the image file
    with open(image_path, "rb") as image_file:
        base64_encoded_data = base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode('utf-8')

    # Include the image file data in the prompt
    data_url = f"data:{mime_type};base64,{base64_encoded_data}"
    response = chat_client.complete(
        messages=[
            SystemMessage(system_message),
            UserMessage(content=[
                TextContentItem(text=prompt),
                ImageContentItem(image_url=ImageUrl(url=data_url))
            ]),
        ]
    )
    print(response.choices[0].message.content)
    ```

    **C#**

    ```csharp
   // Get a response to image input
   string imagePath = "mystery-fruit.jpeg";
   string mimeType = "image/jpeg";
    
   // Read and encode the image file
   byte[] imageBytes = File.ReadAllBytes(imagePath);
   var binaryImage = new BinaryData(imageBytes);
    
   // Include the image file data in the prompt
   ChatCompletionsOptions requestOptions = new ChatCompletionsOptions()
   {
        Messages = {
            new ChatRequestSystemMessage(system_message),
            new ChatRequestUserMessage([
                new ChatMessageTextContentItem(prompt),
                new ChatMessageImageContentItem(bytes: binaryImage, mimeType: mimeType) 
            ]),
        },
        Model = model_deployment
   };
   var response = chat.Complete(requestOptions);
   Console.WriteLine(response.Value.Content);
    ```

2. Use the **CTRL+S** command to save your changes to the code file. You can also close the code editor (**CTRL+Q**) if you like.

3. In the cloud shell command line pane beneath the code editor, enter the following command to run the app:

    **Python**

    ```
   python chat-app.py
    ```

    **C#**

    ```
   dotnet run
    ```

4. When prompted, enter the following prompt:

    ```
   What is this fruit? What recipes could I use it in?
    ```

5. Review the response. Then enter `quit` to exit the program.

    > **Note**: In this simple app, we haven't implemented logic to retain conversation history; so the model will treat each prompt as a new request with no context of the previous prompt.

## Explore further: (If time permits)

You've learned how to use the Azure AI Inference SDK and a multimodal model to implement a generative AI app that can respond to image-based prompts. If you have time, here are some ideas for further exploration.

### Use a different multimodal model

You've used a *Phi-4-multimodal-instruct* model to generate a response to an image-based prompt. Now let's try an OpenAI *gpt-4o* model.

1. In Azure AI Foundry, deploy a **gpt-4o** model to an Azure AI Model Inference endpoint (you may need to create a new resource in a different region).
1. Update the code configuration file for your app (*.env* for Python, *appsettings.json* for C#) to specify the name of your gpt-4o model.
1. Run the app as before, using the same prompts (you can revert to the code that uses a URL-based image if you like).

### Use OpenAI APIs

The code you used in this exercise is based on the Azure AI Inference SDK, which works with any model deployed to an Azure AI Model Inference endpoint. When using an OpenAI model, you can alternatively use the OpenAI SDK.

The following instructions assume you have completed this exercise and the additional task above to deploy and test a **gpt-4o** model.

1. Install (or update) the necessary packages for your app:

    **Python**

    ```
   python -m venv labenv
   ./labenv/bin/Activate.ps1
   pip install python-dotenv azure-identity azure-ai-projects openai
    ```
    
    **C#**

    ```
   dotnet add package Azure.Identity
   dotnet add package Azure.AI.Projects --prerelease
   dotnet add package Azure.AI.OpenAI --prerelease
    ```

1. Update the namespaces in your code file (removing *azure.ai-inference* references):

    **Python**

    ```python
   # Add references
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
   from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
   import openai
    ```

    **C#**

    ```csharp
   // Add references
   using Azure.Identity;
   using Azure.AI.Projects;
   using OpenAI.Chat;
   using Azure.AI.OpenAI;
    ```

1. Modify code to get a chat client:

    **Python**

    ```python
   # Get a chat client
   chat_client = project_client.inference.get_azure_openai_client(api_version="2024-10-21")
    ```

    **C#**

    ```csharp
   // Get a chat client
   ChatClient chatClient = projectClient.GetAzureOpenAIChatClient(model_deployment);
    ```

1. Modify the code to get a completion based on a local image file

    **Python**

    ```python
   # Get a response to image input
   script_dir = Path(__file__).parent  # Get the directory of the script
   image_path = script_dir / 'mystery-fruit.jpeg'
   mime_type = "image/jpeg"

   # Read and encode the image file
   with open(image_path, "rb") as image_file:
        base64_encoded_data = base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode('utf-8')

   # Include the image file data in the prompt
   data_url = f"data:{mime_type};base64,{base64_encoded_data}"
   response = chat_client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model_deployment,
        messages=[
            { "role": "system", "content": system_message },
            { "role": "user", "content": [  
                { 
                    "type": "text", 
                    "text": prompt 
                },
                { 
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {
                        "url": data_url
                    }
                }
            ] } 
        ]
   )
   completion = response.choices[0].message.content
   print(completion)
    ```

    **C#**

    ```csharp
   // Get a response to image input
   string imagePath = "mystery-fruit.jpeg";
   string mimeType = "image/jpeg";
    
   // Read and encode the image file
   byte[] imageBytes = File.ReadAllBytes(imagePath);
   var binaryImage = new BinaryData(imageBytes);

   // Include the image file data in the prompt
   List<ChatMessage> messages =
   [
        new SystemChatMessage(system_message),
        new UserChatMessage(
            ChatMessageContentPart.CreateTextPart(prompt),
            ChatMessageContentPart.CreateImagePart(binaryImage, mimeType)),
   ];

   ChatCompletion completion = chatClient.CompleteChat(messages);
   Console.WriteLine(completion.Content[0].Text);
    ```

1. Save your changes and run the app to test it with the same prompts you used previously.

## Clean up

If you've finished exploring Azure AI Foundry, you should delete the resources you have created in this exercise to avoid incurring unnecessary Azure costs.

1. Return to the browser tab containing the Azure portal (or re-open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) at `https://portal.azure.com` in a new browser tab) and view the contents of the resource group where you deployed the resources used in this exercise.
1. On the toolbar, select **Delete resource group**.
1. Enter the resource group name and confirm that you want to delete it.
